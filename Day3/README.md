# Intro
This repository serves as a demonstration of how FMU's can be simulated in Python with FMPy and how ModestPy can be used for estimating parameters. The model is adapted from the OU44 Modelica library available [here](https://github.com/sdu-cfei/OU44).

The data was collected as a part of the Elforsk project *Data-driven building management and commissioning focusing on energy and indoor climate*. All use of the data and/or this notebook requires proper reference to the author(s):
