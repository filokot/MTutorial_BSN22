# Day 2 
This repository serves as a demonstration of how a white-box model of an HVAC system in buildings can be developed using Buildings and IDEAS libraries' templates. 

The school model has been developed using IDEAS templates as a part of Smart Cities Accelerator+ sponsored by the Interreg EU’s regionale fond: Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak (https://smartcitiesaccelerator.eu/). All use of the data requires proper reference to the project.
