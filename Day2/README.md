# Intro 
This repository serves as a demonstration of how a white-box model of a residential building can be developed using IDEAS library templates. The model has been developed as a part of Smart Cities Accelerator+ sponsored by the Interreg EU’s regionale fond: Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak (https://smartcitiesaccelerator.eu/). All use of the data and/or this notebook requires proper reference to the project.
