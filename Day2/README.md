# Intro 
This repository serves as a demonstration of how a white-box model of a residential building can be developed using IDEAS library templates. 

The school model has been developed as a part of Smart Cities Accelerator+ sponsored by the Interreg EU’s regionale fond: Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak (https://smartcitiesaccelerator.eu/). All use of the data and/or this notebook requires proper reference to the project. 

The heater model has been developed as a demonstration of how examples from Modelica Buildings can be used to learn Modelica and therefore should used with the reference to the Buildings Library group at LBNL (https://www.bing.com/search?q=buildings+library&FORM=AWRE).
