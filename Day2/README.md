# Day 2

This repository serves as demonstration of how a white-box model of HVAC and Building systems can be developed using MSL, Buildings and IDEAS libraries. 

The school model has been developed using IDEAS templates as a part of Smart Cities Accelerator+ sponsored by the Interreg EU’s regionale fond: Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak (https://smartcitiesaccelerator.eu/). All use of the data requires proper reference to the project.

Other models serve only for demonstration of how the examples from from MSL and buildings should be understood and used for self-teaching. Refer to MSL and Buildings libraries for the original examples, explanations and references.
